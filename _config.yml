  Hi, I'm Nicolas, a **DevOps Engineer** with over 5 years of experience in production environments and infrastructure automation. 
  
  I transitioned from Production Engineering to DevOps because I'm passionate about **open-source technologies** and modern tooling. Over the past 5 years as a DevOps Engineer, I've worked with leading companies including <mark>Orange</mark>, <mark>Euronext</mark>, and currently <mark>Société Générale</mark>, where I've been delivering infrastructure solutions for the past 2 years.

  What drives me in this role is the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies and continuously expand my skill set with industry-leading tools. I thrive in environments where I can automate, optimize, and innovate.

  Key areas of expertise:
    - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
    - CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
    - Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
    - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
    - Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)

          I contribute to the modernization of technical environments and the automation of operational processes within Société Générale’s information system.
      
          **Key achievements:**
      
          • Designed, implemented, and maintained **GitHub Actions workflows** to handle the build process of backend, frontend, and batch applications (CI).  
          • Automated the **deployment process** using GitHub Actions, **Helm**, **ArgoCD**, and **Kubernetes** (CD).
      
          • Worked on the **private cloud platform (DoItNow)**, including the integration, monitoring, and maintenance of components such as **RabbitMQ**, **OCP**, **PostgreSQL**, **Elasticsearch**, **Kibana**, **Vault**, **DNS**, and **certificates**.
      
          • Led the **migration of Grafana instances** to a centralized **Dataviz platform**, improving observability and monitoring reliability.
      
          • Managed the **migration of Oracle databases** from **Gen1 to Gen2** on private cloud (OCP).  
            Prior to that, I **automated instance provisioning using Terraform** to ensure faster and more reliable deployments.
      
          • Automated and orchestrated operational tasks using **Kubernetes CronJobs** and **Python**.
      
          • Enhanced **logging** and improved the **resilience of Python scripts** in production.
      
          • Authored **technical documentation** and promoted **best practices** within the team.
      
          • Provided **production support** and **incident management**, including out-of-hours interventions.
      
          • Contributed to the **progressive decommissioning of legacy Gen1 environments and services**.
      
          • Performed **continuous technology watch** on **DevOps, CI/CD, and observability tools**.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
